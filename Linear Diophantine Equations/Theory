general LDE : ax+by=c

classical problems:  find one solution
                     find all solution
                     solutions in a given interval
                     solution with maximum value of x+y


# degenerate case:      when a=0 and b=0 then
                      no solution (c=0) else
                      infinite solution (c!=0)



# finding one solution: this uses the extended euclidean algorithm

                    ~  a and b are non-negative
                    now we apply extended euclidean algorithm to find
                    1) gcd of a and b
                    2) two values x1 and y1

                    such that  a(x1)+b(y1)=g(__gcd(a,b));

                    now if c is divisible by g then we have a solution otherwise

                    if c is divisible and we have a solution then
                    one of the solution is:
                   from this equation : a*x1*(c/g) + b*y1*(c/g) =g
                    s1=x1*(c/g)  and s2=y1*(c/g)

# getting all solutions :

                    from s1 and s2 we can get the other solutions to the equation

                    as a*s1+b*s2=c

                    now adding b/g to s1 and removing a/g from s2 would not break anything in the equation


                    so : a(s1+b/g)+b(s2-a/g )=as1+bs2+a*b/g-b*a/g=c

                    so the general solution for this equation will be

                    x=s1+k*b/g
                    y=s2-k*a/g




# finding no of solution in given range: can be played along with the use of general solution of the equation

# finding solution with maximum value of x+y


(From above)
x+y        = s1+s2+k(b-a)/g

if a<b then select smallest value of k
if a>b then select the largest value of k



#general Method to Solve LDE:  ax+by=c

 1) divide LDE by g i,e g=gcd(a,b)

 2) now gcd(a,b)==1

 3) find solution to aU+bY=1 using extended euclidean algorithm

 4) multiply equation by c  now we have a(Uc)+v=b(Yc)=c

 so our solution will be Uc and Yc
